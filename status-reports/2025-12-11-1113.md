STOPPED/NON-RUNNING SERVICES (1):
⚠ rendered-permissions-1 - Created (not started, likely a one-time init container)

ISSUES FOUND:

⚠ MINOR - Gluetun (VPN):
  - IPv6 warning: "OpenVPN was configured to add an IPv6 route. However, no IPv6
    has been configured for tun0, therefore the route installation may fail or
    may not work as expected."
  - Impact: Low - IPv4 VPN routing working normally, IPv6 not configured
  - Action: Can be ignored unless IPv6 routing is needed

⚠ MODERATE - Sonarr (TV Management):
  - Repeated errors: "DetectSample: Failed to get runtime from the file, make
    sure ffprobe is available"
  - Impact: Sonarr may have difficulty analyzing some media file metadata
  - Possible causes:
    1. Missing ffprobe binary in container
    2. Corrupted/incomplete media files
    3. Unsupported media formats
  - Action: Verify ffprobe is installed in Sonarr container, check media file integrity
